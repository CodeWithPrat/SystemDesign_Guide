## Introduction to System Design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a crucial skill for software engineers, particularly those working on large-scale applications.

The ability to design scalable, reliable, and efficient systems is highly valued in the tech industry and is often a key component of technical interviews at leading companies.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the essential concepts, practices, and resources needed to master system design.

## Step 1: Fundamentals of System Design

### What is System Design?

System design is the process of designing the elements of a system such as the architecture, modules, and components, the different interfaces of those components, and the data that goes through the system. It aims to satisfy specific requirements and constraints while optimizing for factors such as performance, scalability, and cost.

### Low-Level vs. High-Level Design

**High-Level Design (HLD):**
- Focuses on the overall system architecture
- Identifies major components and their interactions
- Defines data flows between components
- Establishes technology choices
- Outlines deployment strategies

**Low-Level Design (LLD):**
- Details the implementation of specific components
- Defines class structures, method signatures, and relationships
- Specifies algorithms and data structures
- Provides sequence diagrams for complex processes
- Addresses error handling and edge cases

### Functional vs. Non-functional Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Define what the system should do
- Specify features and capabilities
- Example: "Users should be able to upload images"
- Focus on user interactions and system behaviors
- Can be verified through testing

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- Define how the system should work
- Address qualities like performance, security, and reliability
- Example: "The system should respond within 200ms"
- Often more challenging to measure and implement
- Critical for system success and user satisfaction

### Key System Design Principles

#### Scalability
The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.

**Types of Scalability:**
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**: Adding more resources to existing machines
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**: Adding more machines to the system

#### Availability
The proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when required.

**Factors affecting availability:**
- Hardware/software failures
- Network issues
- Maintenance windows
- Attacks (e.g., DDoS)

**Measuring availability:**
- Usually expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.99% = "four nines")
- Calculated as: (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time Ã— 100%

#### Reliability
The ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period.

**Strategies for improving reliability:**
- Redundancy
- Failover mechanisms
- Comprehensive testing
- Fault isolation

#### Performance
How efficiently a system uses resources to fulfill its functions.

**Key performance metrics:**
- **Latency**: Time taken to respond to a request
- **Throughput**: Number of operations processed per unit time
- **Response time**: Time from request to response completion

#### Maintainability
The ease with which a system can be modified, corrected, or enhanced.

**Factors affecting maintainability:**
- Code quality and documentation
- Modularity and loose coupling
- Testing coverage
- Consistent coding standards

## Step 2: Network & Communication Basics

### HTTP vs. HTTPS

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
- Application layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents
- Stateless protocol operating on TCP/IP
- Default port: 80
- Not secure; data transmitted in plaintext

**HTTPS (HTTP Secure):**
- HTTP over TLS/SSL encryption
- Encrypts data between client and server
- Default port: 443
- Provides authentication, privacy, and integrity
- Uses certificates for server identity verification

### DNS (Domain Name System)

**Purpose:**
- Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses
- Hierarchical, distributed database system

**Components:**
- **DNS Resolver**: Client-side service that queries DNS servers
- **Root Servers**: Top of the DNS hierarchy
- **TLD Servers**: Manage top-level domains (.com, .org, etc.)
- **Authoritative Servers**: Contain actual DNS records

**DNS Record Types:**
- **A Record**: Maps domain to IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record**: Maps domain to IPv6 address
- **CNAME Record**: Canonical name (alias) for a domain
- **MX Record**: Mail exchange server
- **NS Record**: Name server for the domain
- **SOA Record**: Start of Authority; contains administrative info
- **TXT Record**: Text information

**DNS Caching:**

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

**Purpose:**
- Distributed network of servers that deliver web content close to users
- Reduces latency and improves performance
- Provides DDoS protection and traffic offloading

**How CDNs Work:**
1. User requests content from website
2. Request routed to nearest CDN edge server
3. Edge server checks cache for content
4. If cached (cache hit), serves content directly
5. If not cached (cache miss), retrieves from origin server and caches

**Types of Content Cached:**

- Lower latency for real-time applications
- Efficient for continuous data exchange
- Supported by modern browsers

**Long Polling:**
- Client sends HTTP request
- Server holds request until data is available or timeout occurs
- Client immediately sends new request after receiving response
- Higher latency than WebSockets
- Compatible with older browsers
- Simpler to implement

**Use Cases:**
- **WebSockets**: Chat applications, live dashboards, collaborative tools
- **Long Polling**: Notifications, status updates, compatibility requirements

## Step 3: Database Design

### SQL vs. NoSQL Databases

**SQL (Relational) Databases:**
- Structured data in tables with predefined schemas
- ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Powerful querying capabilities with SQL
- Vertical scaling (primarily)
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

**NoSQL Databases:**
- Flexible schemas for unstructured or semi-structured data
- Horizontal scaling (generally)
- Typically sacrifice ACID for performance and scalability
- Categories:
  - **Document**: MongoDB, CouchDB (JSON-like documents)
  - **Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB (simple key-value pairs)
  - **Column-Family**: Cassandra, HBase (column-oriented)
  - **Graph**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune (nodes and edges)

**Choosing Between SQL and NoSQL:**
- **Choose SQL when**:
  - Data is structured and unlikely to change
  - Complex queries and transactions are needed
  - Data integrity is crucial
  - Relationships between data are important

- **Choose NoSQL when**:
  - Handling large volumes of unstructured data
  - High write throughput is required
  - Horizontal scalability is essential
  - Flexible schema is needed for evolving data

### Database Normalization & Indexing

**Database Normalization:**
- Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity
- Involves breaking down tables into smaller, related tables

**Normalization Forms:**
- **1NF**: Eliminate duplicate columns, create separate tables for related data
- **2NF**: Meet 1NF requirements and all columns depend on the primary key
- **3NF**: Meet 2NF requirements and columns are not transitively dependent
- **BCNF**: More stringent version of 3NF
- **4NF, 5NF**: Address multi-valued dependencies and join dependencies

**Indexing:**
- Data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations
- Types:
  - **Primary Index**: On primary key
  - **Secondary Index**: On non-primary key columns
  - **Composite Index**: On multiple columns
  - **Clustered Index**: Determines physical order of data
  - **Non-Clustered Index**: Separate structure with pointers to data

**Indexing Considerations:**
- Improves read performance but may slow writes
- Requires additional storage space
- Choose columns based on query patterns
- Monitor and maintain indexes for optimal performance

### Sharding, Replication, and Partitioning

**Sharding:**
- Horizontal partitioning of data across multiple databases
- Each shard contains a subset of the data
- Improves scalability and performance

**Sharding Strategies:**
- **Range-Based**: Divide data based on ranges of values
- **Hash-Based**: Use a hash function to determine shard
- **Directory-Based**: Maintain a lookup table for shard locations

**Replication:**
- Maintaining multiple copies of data across different nodes
- Improves availability and read performance

**Replication Models:**
- **Master-Slave**: Writes to master, reads from slaves
- **Multi-Master**: Multiple nodes accept writes
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Equal nodes, no central master

**Partitioning:**
- Dividing a database into distinct, independent parts
- Types:
  - **Vertical Partitioning**: Split table columns
  - **Horizontal Partitioning**: Split table rows (similar to sharding)

### CAP Theorem

**CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem):**
States that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these three properties simultaneously:

- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without guarantee of current data
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues to operate despite network partitions

**Practical Implications:**
- **CA Systems**: Sacrifice partition tolerance (rare in distributed systems)
- **CP Systems**: Sacrifice availability during partitions (e.g., MongoDB)
- **AP Systems**: Sacrifice consistency during partitions (e.g., Cassandra)

### ACID vs. BASE

**ACID Properties:**
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency**: Transactions maintain database integrity
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere
- **Durability**: Committed transactions persist

**BASE Properties:**
- **Basically Available**: System guarantees availability
- **Soft state**: State may change over time without input
- **Eventually consistent**: System becomes consistent over time

**Comparison:**
- ACID focuses on consistency and reliability
- BASE focuses on availability and performance
- ACID typical in traditional relational databases
- BASE common in distributed NoSQL systems

### Caching Strategies

**Caching Purpose:**
- Reduce database load
- Improve response times
- Enhance scalability

**Common Caching Systems:**
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store
- **Memcached**: Distributed memory caching system

**Caching Strategies:**
- **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**: Application checks cache first, loads from DB if miss
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and DB simultaneously
- **Write-Behind (Write-Back)**: Write to cache, asynchronously update DB
- **Read-Through**: Cache automatically loads from DB on miss

**Cache Eviction Policies:**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Discard least recently accessed items
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Discard least frequently accessed items
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Discard oldest items
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Expire items after a set time

**Cache Consistency Challenges:**
- Stale data
- Cache invalidation
- Thundering herd problem (cache stampede)

## Step 4: Scalability & Load Balancing

2. Server responds with ServerHello, certificate, cipher selection
3. Client verifies certificate and sends session key
4. Server acknowledges and begins encrypted communication

**Certificate Types:**
- **Domain Validated (DV)**: Basic identity verification
- **Organization Validated (OV)**: Additional organization checks
- **Extended Validation (EV)**: Rigorous identity verification
- **Wildcard**: Covers all subdomains
- **Multi-domain (SAN)**: Multiple domains on one certificate

**TLS Best Practices:**
- Use TLS 1.3 or latest version
- Implement secure cipher suites
- Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Use Certificate Transparency (CT)
- Regular certificate renewal
